# Docker_Notes
Docker by using AWS EC2 instance and Putty

### Docker is an open source centralised platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.

## Why Docker ?
• An application works in developers machine but not in testing and production. This is due to difference in computer environment between developer, testing and production.

• Docker provides consisting computing environment throughout the whole SDLC.

• It allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole vitual operating system.
